## Meet Cortex

Building an AI app shouldn't mean reinventing memory, search, and personalization from scratch. We were tired of hacking together brittle pipelines - embedding tools, vector databases, ranking tweaks, caching layers just to make AI apps _barely_ feel intelligent. Why wasn't there a Stripe-like SDK for memory and retrieval? So we built it.

**Cortex** is the world's smartest plug-and-play memory infrastructure. It powers intelligent, context-aware recall for AI. Whether you're building a customer support agent, research copilot, or internal knowledge assistant. It is the leading memory layer for AI with the highest benchmark scores ever recorded: https://research.usecortex.ai/cortex.pdf

### Key Features

- **Built-in long-term memory** that evolves with every user interaction
- **Smart recall** that always retrieves the most personalized context for your agents
- **Developer-first SDK** with the most flexible APIs and fine-grained controls
- **Easiest one-click self-hosting** to deploy your own instance with a single-line Docker command

## Not Just Memory. Unlock Intelligence That Compounds.

Cortex isn't just to store context - it **learns** from every interaction and gets smarter with every interaction. Let your agents grow smarter, become your personalized over time, and recall context that matters. 

- **Remember everything** — past searches, preferences, outcomes, conversations, and context
- **Evolve continuously** — memories update and refine with each interaction
- **Personalize instantly** — every response reflects what your AI has learned

The more your users interact, the smarter your agents become.
