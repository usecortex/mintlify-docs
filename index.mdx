## Meet Cortex

Building an AI app shouldn't mean reinventing memory, search, and personalization from scratch.
We were tired of hacking together brittle pipelines—embedding tools, vector databases, ranking tweaks, caching layers—just to make AI apps _barely_ feel intelligent. Why wasn't there a Stripe-like SDK for memory and retrieval? So we built it.

**Cortex** is the world's best plug-and-play memory infrastructure. It powers intelligent, context-aware recall for any AI app or agent. Whether you're building a customer support bot, research copilot, or internal knowledge assistant. It is the leading memory layer for AI with the highest benchmark scores ever recorded: https://research.usecortex.ai/cortex.pdf

### Key Features

- **Built-in long-term memory** that evolves with every user interaction
- **Dynamic retrieval and querying** that always retrieve the most relevant context
- **Developer-first SDK** with the most flexible APIs and fine-grained controls

## Not Just Memory. Intelligence That Compounds.

Cortex doesn't just store context — it **learns** from every interaction and gets smarter over time.

- **Remember everything** — past searches, preferences, conversations, and context
- **Evolve continuously** — memories update and refine with each interaction
- **Personalize instantly** — every response reflects what your AI has learned

The more your users interact, the smarter your agents become.
