# OpenAPI.json - needs to be edited so that the page headings and sub headings can be edited properly 
# Docs.json - needs to be edited so that the routes and links are updated 
# .mdx - needs to be edited so that the body of the page can be edited 

## We generate API parameters from the backend. We ignore the usage of doc strings from the code base. All the body content of every API needs to be written in the .mdx files
