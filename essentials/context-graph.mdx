title: "Context Graphs"
description: "Cortex automatically builds a context graph from your content, extracting entities and their relationships to help your AI understand not just individual pieces of information, but how everything connects."
---

This means your agents don’t just retrieve documents — they reason over a **web of relationships** across users, projects, systems, and knowledge.

Where traditional semantic search answers:

> "What is similar?"

Cortex’s context graph answers:

> "How is everything actually related?"

---

## What Is a Context Graph?

A context graph is a network of:

- **Entities** — people, organizations, projects, products, systems, concepts
- **Relationships** — how those entities interact, depend on each other, or evolve

Instead of treating each document as isolated text, Cortex understands the **underlying structure** of your information.

### Example

Query:

> "Project Phoenix budget"

Semantic search returns:

- Documents mentioning "Phoenix" and "budget"

Cortex’s context graph understands:

- Sarah Chen leads Project Phoenix
- Project Phoenix depends on the Authentication Service
- It was approved by the Engineering VP
- It has a Q2 deadline

This is **relational context** — not just text similarity.

---

## How It Works

### Automatic Entity Extraction

When you upload content, Cortex automatically:

- Identifies entities in your documents
- Extracts relationships between entities
- Builds a connected graph
- Updates continuously as new content arrives

No schemas. No tagging. No configuration.

The graph is built **entirely automatically**.

---

## Intelligent Entity Disambiguation

Real data is messy. Names repeat. Concepts overlap.

Cortex resolves ambiguity using:

- Surrounding context
- Source type (email, doc, ticket, chat)
- Unique identifiers (emails, URLs, IDs)
- Relationship patterns

So "Mercury" the engineer is never confused with "Mercury" the customer or "Mercury" the project.

---

## Cross-Source Entity Linking

Cortex links entities across systems automatically.

Examples:

- Two docs mention "John Smith" → both reference [john.smith@company.com](mailto:john.smith@company.com) → merged
- Slack thread and Notion doc both discuss "Project Phoenix" → linked
- CRM record and support ticket share customer_id → unified

The graph becomes a **single source of truth across tools**.

---

## Closing the Semantic Gap

Vector search understands _meaning_.\
Context graphs understand _structure_.

Vector search can find:

> "critical bug"

But it cannot know:

- That the bug in Doc A is the same as Ticket #4821
- That three teams are working on related systems
- That the issue impacts a revenue-critical workflow

Context graphs bridge this gap by modeling **explicit relationships**, not just semantic similarity.

---

## Entity Types

Cortex recognizes entities such as:

- People
- Organizations
- Projects
- Products
- Systems
- APIs
- Error codes
- Concepts

Each entity includes:

- Name
- Type
- Namespace
- Relationships

---

## Relationship Context

Every relationship captures:

- Relationship type (WORKS_AT, DEPENDS_ON, REPORTS_TO)
- Rich natural language context
- Source evidence
- Temporal signals

This enables Cortex to reason about:

- Dependencies
- Ownership
- Causality
- Responsibility

---

## Automatic Availability

Context graph signals are **automatically included in all recall and search responses**.

You don’t need special APIs.

Every Cortex retrieval call benefits from the graph.

---

## Using Graph Context

Search responses include:

- `chunk_triplets` — entity relationships per chunk
- `entity_paths` — multi-hop relationship chains

### entity_paths

Best for:

- "How is X related to Y?"
- "Who owns this system?"
- "What depends on this service?"

Each path contains a pre-computed summary of the full relationship chain.

---

## Why This Matters for AI Agents

Context graphs enable agents to:

- Perform multi-hop reasoning
- Answer relational questions
- Understand organizational structure
- Track dependencies and impact
- Ground answers in real-world relationships

This turns agents from **search engines** into **reasoning systems**.

---

## Key Benefits

- Deeper understanding of complex domains
- Richer context for every response
- Higher relevance
- Automatic maintenance
- Tenant-level isolation

---

## Use Cases

- Customer support → link issues to systems and solutions
- Sales → connect prospects to products and case studies
- Research → relate papers, authors, and findings
- Project management → track teams, dependencies, deadlines
- Onboarding → map org structure and stakeholders

---

## Best Practices

- Include unique identifiers (emails, IDs, URLs)
- Write clearly and consistently
- Use structured content where possible

The more signal in your data, the smarter the graph becomes.

---

## The Big Picture

Vector databases give you similarity.

Context graphs give you **understanding**.

Cortex uses both together.

That’s what allows your agents to move from:

> "finding information"

to

> "reasoning about reality."
