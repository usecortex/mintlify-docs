title: "Shared / Hive Memory"
description: "Shared intelligence across your entire agent network. What if every agent in your system could learn from every other agent? That's Hive Memories. Shared intelligence across your entire agent network. When one agent discovers a better workflow, every agent knows. When a customer flags an issue, no agent makes that mistake again. When new company policies roll out, every agent is instantly aligned. Humans evolved through shared learning. Your agents can too. Hive Memories maintains a living system of record - capturing learnings, corrections, and institutional knowledge that compound across every interaction."
