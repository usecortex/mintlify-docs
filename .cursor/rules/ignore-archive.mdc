# Ignore Archive Folder

When making edits or refactors in this project:

- **Do not modify** any files under the `archive/` folder.
- Apply changes only to files outside `archive/`.
- If a change would affect both archive and non-archive files, update only the non-archive files.

The archive is kept for reference only and should remain unchanged.
