The Cortex SDK is designed to give you the most flexible developer experience for building AI apps and agents. Set up a global memory store for individual users (B2C), or configure organizations as tenants and onboard their users (B2B).

## Core Concepts

### Tenants

Think of a **tenant** as a completely separate workspace or organization in your Cortex application. It's like having different "companies" or "projects" that can't see each other's data.

**Simple Analogy**: Imagine you're building a knowledge management system for multiple companies. Each company gets their own "tenant" - like separate office buildings where employees can't access each other's files.

Cortex supports both **B2C** and **B2B** use cases:

- **B2C (Business-to-Consumer)**: Each individual user gets their own private workspace within your single tenant. Perfect for personal AI assistants or individual productivity apps.
- **B2B (Business-to-Business)**: Each organization gets their own tenant with complete data isolation. Perfect for enterprise software serving multiple companies.

### Sub-Tenants

A **sub-tenant** is like a department or team within an organization. It provides an additional layer of organization within a tenant.

**Simple Analogy**: If a tenant is like a company, then sub-tenants are like departments (Engineering, Sales, HR) within that company. Each department has its own space, but they're all part of the same company.

**Key Benefits**:

- **Complete Data Isolation**: No tenant can ever see another tenant's data
- **Organized Workspaces**: Sub-tenants help organize data within large organizations
- **Flexible Access Control**: Control who can access what data at both tenant and sub-tenant levels
- **Scalable Architecture**: Serve unlimited organizations and their subdivisions
- **Automatic Creation**: Sub-tenants are created automatically when you first use a new `sub_tenant_id` that doesn't exist yet. There's no separate API call required.

**How It Works**:

1. **First Upload**: When you upload content with a new `sub_tenant_id`, Cortex automatically creates that sub-tenant
2. **Immediate Availability**: The sub-tenant is immediately available for all subsequent operations
3. **No Setup Required**: No configuration or setup is needed - just start using the new `sub_tenant_id`

**Best Practice - Use User IDs for B2C Applications**:

```javascript
// For individual user workspaces, use user IDs as sub-tenant IDs
sub_tenant_id: "user_12345"    // User's personal workspace
sub_tenant_id: "user_67890"    // Another user's workspace
```


**Best Practice - Use Descriptive Names for B2B Applications**:


```javascript
// For organizational subdivisions, use descriptive names
sub_tenant_id: "engineering"   // Engineering department
sub_tenant_id: "sales"         // Sales team
sub_tenant_id: "hr"            // Human Resources
```


### Knowledge

These are the atoms that make up the context store for your agents. This includes any type of documents, emails, messages, images, webpages, presentations, reports, any form of unstructured information. Cortex can also digest CSVs..
Each piece of knowledge you add is meticulously cleaned, parsed using in-house parsers, prepared for the most optimal recall experience for your agents.

### Memory

Memory is where personalization lives. This is what the AI has to remember about each individual user: preferences, past interactions, likes, dislikes, behavioral patterns, and personal context.

- Think of it as an ever evolving cache of user preferences, past interactions, likes, dislikes, behavioral patterns, and personal context - not just what they said, but what they meant and what they've done before.
- Cortex memories update automatically through conversation, queries, and usage, giving your app the ability to learn, evolve, remember, and adapt.

### Recall
Recall is how you extract the most meaningful context for your agents to perform their tasks: performing actions, answering questions, or running workflows.
Cortex gives you control over **how recall works** with a combination of parameters and recall strategies.

### Metadata

Metadata allows you to structure and filter retrieval with precision. You can tag documents, pages, or entities with key-value pairs and filter results by user role, product, team, time, or any custom logic.
- **Tenant Metadata**: Organization-level metadata that applies consistently across all documents within a tenant
- **Memory Metadata**: Document-specific metadata that varies from memory to memory 
- **Metadata Filtering**: Use this to filter results by any custom logic you need
